# Chapter 3 --- Actuators and Motion Systems in Humanoid Robotics

Actuators are the "muscles" of humanoid robots. They convert electrical,
hydraulic, or pneumatic energy into motion. The design of a robot's
motion system determines its strength, speed, balance, and ability to
perform human-like movements such as walking, lifting, and manipulating
objects.

## 3.1 What Are Actuators?

An actuator is a device that creates movement.

Actuators power: - Joint rotations - Arm movements - Leg locomotion -
Hand and finger control - Torso bending and balancing

## 3.2 Types of Actuators Used in Humanoid Robots

### Electric Motors

-   Servo motors
-   Brushless DC motors (BLDC)
-   Stepper motors

### Hydraulic Actuators

Used for extremely high force tasks.

### Pneumatic Actuators

Lightweight, fast, but less precise.

### Artificial Muscles

Emerging technology for human-like motion.

## 3.3 Motion Systems in Humanoids

### Joint Mechanisms

-   Revolute joints
-   Prismatic joints
-   Ball joints

### Gear Systems

-   Planetary gears
-   Harmonic drives
-   Timing belts

### Tendon-Driven Systems

Cable and pulley-based mechanisms.

## 3.4 Motion Control Algorithms

### PID Control

Used for basic feedback control.

### Model-Based Control

Inverse kinematics and dynamics.

### Machine Learning Based Control

Reinforcement learning for adaptive walking and balance.

## 3.5 Challenges

-   Balance
-   Coordination
-   Smooth movement
-   Energy consumption
-   Overheating

## 3.6 Summary

Actuators and motion systems enable humanoid robots to perform
human-like tasks by combining motors, hydraulics, pneumatics, artificial
muscles, and advanced control algorithms.
